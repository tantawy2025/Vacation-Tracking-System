# Vaction Tracking System




## Overview
Our organization desire to first time create a vacation tracking system as a Web application for both Managers and employee to manage their vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off, without having to be an expert in company policy or the local facility’s leave policies. and the system will be an extension for organization existing system.

## Problem Defination

In the past, all vacation time had to be approved by an immediate manager and then checked by a clerk in the HR department before it was authorized. Sometimes this manual process could take  days.

## Motivation

An automated system will speed up this process and will require at most one manual approval by the immediate manager to streamline the functions of the human resources (HR) department,and to minimize noncore, business-related activities of management, and to give a sense of empowerment to the employees.
## Main Goal
The main goal of this application is to improve the internal business processes of this organization, at least with respect to the time it takes to manage vacation time requests.

## System Goal
the system has the potential to save time and money mostly in the HR department, which is essentially taken out of the individual time request process and replaced by a rules-based validation system
## Vision

Create an automated system that will provide individual employees with the capability to manage their own vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off,without having to be an expert in company policy or the local facility’s leave policies.
